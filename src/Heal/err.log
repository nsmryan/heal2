    • Couldn't match expected type ‘t a -> [(a, a)]’
                  with actual type ‘[(a, a)]’
    • The function ‘pairs’ is applied to one argument,
      but its type ‘[(a, a)]’ has none
      In the second argument of ‘traverse’, namely ‘(pairs t)’
      In the second argument of ‘(<$>)’, namely ‘traverse f (pairs t)’
